# House-Pricing-Predictor

I used linear regression to predict Pricing of the house based on SquareFeet, Bedrooms, Bathrooms and the Year it was built.

I used the SkLearn Library for Linear Regression.

It's Coefficients were: 99.36140678 for SquareFeet, 5073.95875503 for Bedrooms, 2831.33395711 for Bathrooms and -11.01728775 for Year.
And it's Intercept is 23942.926319416176

Complete Code file and Dataset is also Available in the repository.

Example:

Givin Data: 

| SquareFeet | Bedrooms | Bathrooms | YearBuilt | Price |
|------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1100       | 2        | 2         | 2024      | ?     |

# It predicted the output: 126752.0687902$
